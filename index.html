            <h3>Creation Care</h3>
            <p>
              The lawn is one of the fastest emerging landscapes in our nation,
              covering a total area greater than the state of Iowa.  The
              interpretation of what we deem a lawn goes beyond a kind of cultural
              inheritance. The platonic lawn is predominantly a construction of a
              political economy, an industry that creates demand more than it meets
              demand.  This is a part of a complex explanation for how we have
              arrived at a place where our society’s most educated, those most aware
              of the dangers of chemical lawn care, are nevertheless statistically
              the most likely to use these chemicals. Lawn chemical users apply far
              higher quantities of chemical inputs into their lawns than
              agricultural chemical users.  The application of these chemicals
              carries with it environmental consequences.  Furthermore, the highly
              consumptive petroleum-fueled equipment emits massive amounts of air
              pollutants. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, one gas
              mower running for an hour emits the same amount of pollutants as eight
              new cars driving 55 mph for the same amount of time!
            </p>
            <p>
              In accordance with our belief that we are creatures designed and
              commanded by our Creator to tend to and nurture creation, we believe
              there are both alternatives to the lawn, and alternative ways to
              manage the lawn that better care for creation. Conversion’s solar and
              B20 biodiesel-powered equipment reduces the volume of hydrocarbons and
              nitrogen oxides emitted into the atmosphere, and our chemical free
              approach enhances the biotic life of your property as opposed to
              killing it.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="callout">
            <h3>Healthy Living</h3>
            <p>
              There also exists ample evidence that many of the chemical herbicides
              and insecticides applied to achieve the unnatural lawn impose health
              risks to humans and pets. There is of course a debate on this matter
              because millions of dollars are at stake. It is hard to know whom to
              trust, or what levels of toxicity are problematic. There are studies
              showing MCPA and DCPA, common ingredients in herbicides, interfere with
              reproductive capacities. Other studies suggest over the counter 2,4-D
              may have carcinogenic properties. Again, there is a lot of controversy
              over these findings. We at Conversion believe in a conservative
              approach.  <strong>We know our health and the health of our children is
              of the utmost importance, so why take unnecessary risks?</strong> Where
              uncertainty prevails, well-documented historical precedent indicates the
              value of precaution (remember DDT, lead arsenate, and more recently,
              organophosphates).

          <div class="callout">
            <h3>Honesty</h3>
            <p>
              We believe in being as transparent as possible.  Please do not hesitate
              to ask us questions about the business. We are happy to share
              information regarding our approach and products, and how we arrive at
              our pricing.  We believe in just compensation and place a high value on
              the laborer (see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+5%3A4&version=ESV" target="_blank">James 5:4</a>) but we do not believe in the many ways
              businesses enrich themselves at the expense of the consumer or client. A
              brand new truck is in no way a requirement to run a landscaping or lawn
              care service business, so we will not inflate prices to pay for a
              $45,000 truck when my 2006 GMC Sierra, purchased a few years back for
              $6,000 is entirely reliable. (<a href="pricing-calculator.pdf">See our pricing tables here.</a>)

            <h3>Why the name "Conversion"?</h3>
            <p>
              We are in the business of conversion. As a Christian, I am all about
              conversion spiritually and I believe some of the principles of Christian
              conversion cross over and apply nicely to our vision for this business.
              We understand conversion to go beyond a single choice, as important as
              that is, and to encompass a larger process by which we learn, grow and
              are changed. Processes never stagnate, but involve ongoing change.
            </p>
            <p>
              In our approach to lawn care and landscaping, we want to walk alongside
              homeowners as educators, introducing and inspiring residents to think
              outside of cultural norms to become co-creators of a more beautiful
              world.  Our idea of a beautiful world is derived from the biblical
              concept of shalom. Shalom is where God’s creation is interwoven in ways
              that promote life, peace, and flourishing. Shalom doesn’t necessitate we
              all exchange monocultures of gramineae for diverse landscapes
              constructed with native species. But the pulse of shalom will start to
              shift our priorities so that they better align with God’s design and
              perhaps critique our culture’s values.
            </p>
            <p>
              You are not alone on this journey of becoming better stewards of the
              land. We at Conversion want to use our experience and passions to walk
              alongside you. If you are interested in alternatives to the traditional
              lawn, we would be happy to discuss installing an edible landscape and
              alternative ground covers.
